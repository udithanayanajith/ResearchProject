<h1>Crops </h1>
<p class="para">
    The development of agriculture and industry involved a vaster usage of plants than just 
    for eating or feeding domestic animals. Furthermore, when mankind satisfied its primary 
    needs in food and industrial products, it started thinking about the aesthetic side as well. 
    Thus, various plants were used in home d√©cor and landscape design.<br>
    There are several classifications of crops depending on what is taken to determine the ambiguity:
    <ul>
        <li>Season of sowing (spring or fall).</li>
        <li>Origin of plants (local or foreign)..</li>
        <li> Purpose of growing. This classification falls into six basic groups:.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Food crops</h2>
<p class="para">for human needs (e.g. wheat, maize, legumes, rice, potatoes, tomatoes)..</p>
<h2>Feed crops</h2>
<p class="para">or cattle or livestock consumption (e.g. barley, beets, grasses for domestic animals to graze and store as hay or silage).</p>
<h2>Fiber crops:</h2>
<p class="para">for the sake of fibers used in clothes, bedding, industry, and household (hemp, cotton, flax, bamboo).</p>
<h2>Oil crops:</h2>
<p class="para">for oil manufacturing either for machinery fuel (rape) or food industry (sunflower, olives).</p>
<h2>Ornamental crops:</h2>
<p class="para">for home decoration and landscape design (garden or pot flowers and bushes).</p>
<h2>Industrial crops:</h2>
<p class="para">for industrial manufacturing (rubber).</p>
<p class="para">In the rest of the cases, the groups are interchangeable. Thus, 
    wheat and oats can be used both as food and feed crops, depending on their quality. 
    Flax seeds are a useful dietary supplement while its fibers are utilized in textiles.
     Sugarcane is the source of edible sugar and alcohol for bioethanol.
